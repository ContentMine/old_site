A jquery / js thingy that lists and visualises search results from an elasticsearch index.

Uses select2 for dropdown facet suggestions in the search box.

Uses d3 for the vis (it's sooper).

Uses twitter bootstrap for default style.

Inspired by http://github.com/okfn/facetview

Early days yet, still experimental, not well documented, may break.
